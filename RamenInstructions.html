    <p> Instructions </p>
    <p1> 1. Prepare the Broth
      <br>
      <br> </p1> <p2>
      a. In a large pot, heat a tablespoon of oil over medium           heat. Add chopped onion, sliced ginger, and minced garlic.       Saut√© for 3-4 minutes until fragrant.
      <br>
      b. Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring it to a       boil.
      <br>
      c. Add soy sauce and miso paste (if using). Reduce heat to       low and let the broth simmer for at least 30-40 minutes,         allowing the flavors to meld. Season with salt and pepper         to taste.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
    <br> </p2> <p1>
      2. Prepare Toppings
      <br>
    <br> </p1> <p2>
      a. Cook the ramen noodles according to the package               instructions. Drain and set aside.
      <br>
      b. If using meat, cook and slice it thinly. Soft-boil the         eggs (6-7 minutes in boiling water) and peel them.
      <br>
      c. Prepare any additional toppings like sliced green             onions, bean sprouts, nori, corn kernels, or bamboo shoots.      Set them aside for assembly.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
    <br> </p2> <p1>
      3. Assemble the Ramen
      <br>
    <br> </p1> <p2>
      a. Divide the cooked noodles among serving bowls.
      <br>
      b. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles, ensuring they are       fully submerged.
      <br>
      c. Arrange the toppings on the broth and noodles as               desired. Place sliced meat, soft-boiled egg halves, green         onions, nori, bean sprouts, and any other toppings you           prefer.
      <br>
      d. Serve the ramen hot, and you can mix the toppings into         the broth and noodles before eating.
